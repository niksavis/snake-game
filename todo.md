# Snake Game Implementation Todo List

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the classic Snake game that was popular on Nokia phones. The game will run in a browser, featuring the core gameplay mechanics of the original game with some modern enhancements.

## Technology Recommendation

The implementation will use pure browser technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript (no build tools or external dependencies)
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- CSS for styling
- Local browser storage (localStorage) for saving game state

## General Guidelines

- Keep the game mechanics simple and true to the original
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- Focus on performance optimization
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use modular JavaScript patterns without requiring build tools

- [x] Add CSS media queries for different devices

### 6. Testing, Refinement & Documentation

- [x] Verify browser compatibility for Canvas API
- [x] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [x] Test on mobile devices
- [x] Optimize for performance
- [x] Refine controls and gameplay based on testing
- [x] Add comments to code
- [x] Create a README.md with game instructions and controls
- [x] Add favicon for browser tab
- [x] Implement error handling and debugging
- [x] Add layout fixes for responsiveness
- [x] Fix powerup message positioning
- [x] Create additional test files to verify functionality
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages or similar service (optional)

## Project Status: PHASE 2 COMPLETED âœ…

Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the Snake Game have been successfully implemented with all core features and most optional enhancements. The game includes:

- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Touch controls for mobile and keyboard controls for desktop
- Special food items with three different power-ups (speed boost, double points, super growth)
- High score tracking using localStorage
- Sound effects with toggle option (high-quality custom sounds)
- Proper game states (start, playing, game over)
- Visual enhancements and animations
- Embedded SVG favicon
- Adaptive canvas sizing that maintains aspect ratio
- Error handling and debugging functionality
- Proper HTML/CSS layout with responsive design
- Well-structured, maintainable, and commented code

The game uses pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS as specified, with no external dependencies. All Phase 1 features have been tested and are working correctly.

## Phase 2 Tasks

### 1. UI and Layout Improvements

- [x] Move the sound toggle button inside the white canvas/game container
- [x] Fix layout issues on mobile and small screens (game currently pushed to the left)
- [x] Ensure consistent layout across all screen sizes

### 2. Sound Enhancement

- [x] Replace placeholder sound files with real, appropriate sound effects
- [x] Create custom sound for eating regular food
- [x] Create custom sound for game over event
- [x] Create custom sound for snake movement
- [x] Create unique sounds for each power-up type
- [x] Ensure sound files are optimized for web (small file size, good quality)
- [x] Test sound effects across different browsers and devices
- [x] Fix sound loading errors by using embedded base64 audio data
- [x] Solve audio playback issues by implementing Web Audio API for reliable cross-browser sound
- [x] Remove unused sound files and assets directory for cleaner codebase
- [x] Improve moveSound consistency with regular intervals instead of random playback
