# Snake Game Implementation Guide

## Overview

Create a classic Snake game with modern features such as responsive design, touch controls, sound effects, and special power-ups. This guide outlines all necessary tasks to build a complete web-based Snake game.

## Dependencies

- [x] Use only vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML (no external libraries or frameworks)
- [x] Utilize Web Audio API for all sound effects and audio functionality
- [x] Use browser Web APIs for all required functionality (localStorage, requestAnimationFrame, etc.)
- [x] Avoid dependencies on external assets (images, audio files, fonts, etc.)
- [x] Implement all game functionality within the browser environment

## Tasks

### 1. HTML Structure

- [x] Create a basic HTML document with appropriate meta tags and favicon
- [x] Implement three game screens: start screen, game screen, and game-over screen
- [x] Add canvas element for the game rendering
- [x] Set up UI elements: score display, pause button, and sound toggle

### 2. CSS Styling

- [x] Create responsive layout that works on different screen sizes
- [x] Style the game container, screens, buttons, and canvas
- [x] Implement transitions for screen changes
- [x] Create visual styling for game elements (snake, food, special items)
- [x] Add visual feedback for user interactions

### 3. Game Initialization

- [x] Set up event listener for DOM content loaded
- [x] Initialize game variables and state
- [x] Set up canvas and its context
- [x] Create resize handler for responsive canvas
- [x] Load high score from local storage
- [x] Set up event listeners for buttons and keyboard

### 4. Core Game Mechanics

- [x] Implement the main game loop with appropriate timing
- [x] Create snake movement system with directional control
- [x] Add collision detection (walls, self)
- [x] Implement food generation at random positions
- [x] Add scoring system when food is consumed
- [x] Create game over condition and handling

### 5. Advanced Features

- [x] Implement touch controls for mobile devices
- [x] Create pause/resume functionality
- [x] Add special food items with power-ups (speed boost, double points, growth)
- [x] Create visual effects for power-ups
- [x] Implement high score tracking with local storage

### 6. Visual Enhancements

- [x] Snake Appearance:
  - [x] Add simple eyes that follow the direction of movement
  - [x] Implement subtle gradient coloring for snake body
  - [x] Add slightly rounded corners to body segments
  - [x] Add occasional subtle tongue animation (low frequency)

- [x] Food Animation:
  - [x] Create gentle pulsing effect for regular food
  - [x] Add small leaf detail with minimal animation

- [x] Special Food Effects:
  - [x] Implement soft glow effect around special food
  - [x] Add gentle rotation to special food items
  - [x] Use distinct colors for different power-up types
  - [x] Display countdown timer only when nearly expired

- [x] Score Feedback:
  - [x] Add small floating score numbers when points are earned
  - [x] Create subtle pulse effect on score display when updated
  - [x] Show brief power-up text when special food is consumed

### 7. Sound System

- [x] Create audio context and sound generation functions
- [x] Implement different sounds for various game events
- [x] Add sound toggle functionality
- [x] Create fallback mechanisms for browsers without audio support
- [x] Persist sound preferences

### 8. Game Polish

- [x] Add debug functionality for development
- [x] Implement smooth animations
- [x] Create visual feedback for scoring
- [x] Add responsive design considerations
- [ ] Test across different devices and browsers

### 9. Performance Optimization

- [x] Optimize render loop for smooth gameplay
- [x] Implement efficient collision detection

This guide provides all necessary tasks to implement a complete Snake game. The agentic AI should approach these tasks sequentially, implementing each section while maintaining code quality and following web development best practices.
