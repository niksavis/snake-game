# Snake Game Implementation Todo List

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the classic Snake game that was popular on Nokia phones. The game will run in a browser, featuring the core gameplay mechanics of the original game with some modern enhancements.

## Technology Recommendation

The implementation will use pure browser technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript (no build tools or external dependencies)
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- CSS for styling
- Local browser storage (localStorage) for saving game state

## General Guidelines

- Keep the game mechanics simple and true to the original
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- Focus on performance optimization
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use modular JavaScript patterns without requiring build tools

## Implementation Tasks (In Order)

### 1. Project Setup

- [x] Create project directory structure
- [x] Create index.html, style.css, and script.js files
- [ ] Initialize Git repository (optional for tracking changes)

### 2. Core Game Implementation

- [x] Create basic HTML structure with Canvas element
- [x] Design game board layout
- [x] Implement game loop using requestAnimationFrame
- [x] Implement snake rendering on Canvas
- [x] Define snake movement mechanics
- [x] Implement keyboard controls (arrow keys)
- [x] Add collision detection (walls and self)
- [x] Implement food spawning logic
- [x] Add scoring mechanism
- [x] Implement game over conditions

### 3. Game States and UI

- [x] Create game states (start, playing, game over)
- [x] Design and implement start screen
- [x] Add game over screen with final score
- [x] Create score display
- [x] Implement game pausing functionality
- [x] Add simple instructions for players

### 4. Asset Management and Enhancements

- [x] Create/source simple game graphics (snake, food)
- [x] Add sound effects (optional)
- [x] Implement visual feedback (animations, color changes)
- [x] Create a high score system using localStorage
- [x] Add different food types with special effects (optional)
- [x] Implement difficulty levels (speed variations)

### 5. Responsive Design & Accessibility

- [x] Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- [x] Implement touch controls for mobile devices
- [x] Ensure keyboard navigation works properly
- [x] Add proper focus management
- [x] Include appropriate ARIA attributes
- [x] Ensure sufficient color contrast
- [x] Handle window resize events to maintain playable area

### 6. Testing, Refinement & Documentation

- [x] Verify browser compatibility for Canvas API
- [x] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [x] Test on mobile devices
- [x] Optimize for performance
- [x] Refine controls and gameplay based on testing
- [x] Add comments to code
- [x] Create a README.md with game instructions and controls
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages or similar service (optional)
