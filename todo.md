# Snake Game Implementation Todo List

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the classic Snake game that was popular on Nokia phones. The game will run in a browser, featuring the core gameplay mechanics of the original game with some modern enhancements.

## Technology Recommendation

The implementation will use pure browser technologies:

- Vanilla JavaScript (no build tools or external dependencies)
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- CSS for styling
- Local browser storage (localStorage) for saving game state

## General Guidelines

- Keep the game mechanics simple and true to the original
- Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
- Focus on performance optimization
- Maintain clean, well-documented code
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use modular JavaScript patterns without requiring build tools

## Project Status: COMPLETED âœ…

The Snake Game has been successfully implemented with all core features and most optional enhancements. The game includes:

- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Touch controls for mobile and keyboard controls for desktop
- Special food items with three different power-ups (speed boost, double points, super growth)
- High score tracking using localStorage
- Sound effects with toggle option
- Proper game states (start, playing, game over)
- Visual enhancements and animations
- Embedded SVG favicon
- Adaptive canvas sizing that maintains aspect ratio
- Error handling and debugging functionality
- Proper HTML/CSS layout with responsive design
- Well-structured, maintainable, and commented code

The game uses pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and CSS as specified, with no external dependencies. All features have been tested and are working correctly.
